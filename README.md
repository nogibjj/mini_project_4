## mini project 4: GitHub Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions 

This repo contains: 
- .devcontainer     
- .github   
- .gitignore    
- Makefile  
- README.md     
- requirements.txt      
- main.py   
- test_main.py

## Overview
- The purpose of this project is to set up a GitHub Actions workflow and test across at least 3 different Python versions (e.g. 3.8 , 3.9 3.10.x, 3.11). 
- Python scripts are provided for descriptive statistics written in `Pandas` and its associated attributes (e.g.`DataFrame.describe()`). 
- Functions wrote by the authors are `findMin`, `findMax` and `calcMean`.
- Visualizations are produced to demonstrate the relationship between features.

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the testing and building process for a project by utilizing a matrix that includes multiple different versions of Python and two distinct operating systems. This setup allows you to ensure the compatibility and reliability of your code across multiple Python versions and operating system environments.
